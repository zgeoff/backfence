# Agent Guidelines

## Operations

- AGENTS.md is generated from `agents/shared.md` and `agents/project.md` — edit the partials, never
  AGENTS.md itself. The shared partial is synced from
  [zgeoff/tools](https://github.com/zgeoff/tools); cross-project rule changes belong there.
- Perform all work on a branch in a git worktree under `.worktrees/` (e.g.
  `git worktree add .worktrees/<branch> -b <branch>`) — never commit directly on `main`.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages.
- A squash merge makes the PR title the commit subject, so a PR title is a Conventional Commit too.
  `feat(#412): add the retry budget` is a title; `add the retry budget` is not.
- Commit subjects and PR titles use the imperative mood ("add X", never "added X" or a bare noun
  phrase).
- Open PRs against `main` using the PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`). Descriptions
  are condensed: lead paragraph ≤2 sentences, one-line bullets, ≤150 words — write the short version
  first, don't draft long and trim.
- After pushing, link the PR URL in your response.
- A PR is ready only when its checks are green: watch CI (`gh pr checks <n> --watch`) after opening
  or updating, and report a failure with what you're doing about it.

## Code style

Mechanically enforced rules (oxfmt, oxlint, format-codemod) aren't repeated here — this file covers
what tooling can't check.

- One primary export per file, and the file name kebab-cases that export (`with-jest-context.ts`
  exports `withJestContext`). Exceptions: `index.ts` entrypoints, `types.ts` for a package's shared
  types, and side-effect-only modules, which are named for what they do (`augment-bun-test.ts`).
- Module order: imports, the primary export, then private helpers in composition order (depth-first)
  — never helpers first. Supporting declarations (consts, interfaces, type aliases) sit directly
  above their first use, never below it and never leading the file; types for the primary export's
  signature may sit just above it.
- Acronyms stay uppercase in identifiers (`runCLI`, `parseCLIArgs`, `ASTNode`, `pkgURL`,
  `isPackageJSON`) — except when one starts a camelCase name, where it lowercases whole (`cliPath`,
  `astNode`). ID counts as an acronym: `userID`, `sessionID` — never `userId` — and `idToken` when
  it starts a name. File names are unaffected: kebab-case lowercases everything (`parse-cli-args.ts`
  exports `parseCLIArgs`).

### Function naming

Every function name starts with a prefix from the closed list below: pick from it, or extend this
file in the same PR that introduces the new verb. The prefix is a contract — a reader should know
the function's shape without opening it.

**Predicates** — return boolean, no side effects:

| Prefix   | Contract                | Example          |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| `is`     | type or state test      | `isVarDecl`      |
| `has`    | containment, possession | `hasBlankLine`   |
| `can`    | capability              | `canResize`      |
| `should` | policy decision         | `shouldSkipFile` |
| `needs`  | requirement             | `needsBlankLine` |

**Pure producers** — result comes from arguments alone, no side effects:

| Prefix                        | Contract                                                                  | Example             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `build<Result>[From<Source>]` | default constructor for values; drop `From<Source>` when no single source | `buildEditsFromAST` |
| `define<X>`                   | identity; its only job is compile-time constraint of its literal argument | `defineErrors`      |
| `parse`                       | unstructured input → structure, invalid input reported                    | `parseSource`       |
| `encode`                      | structure → its defined compact or wire form, reversed by `decode`        | `encodeState`       |
| `decode`                      | `encode`'s output → the original structure, malformed input reported      | `decodeState`       |

| `find`                        | search that can miss — null/undefined on miss                             | `findPrevious`      |
| `get`                         | cheap access that cannot miss (throwing on a broken invariant is fine)    | `getNodeEnd`        |
| `collect`                     | gather from a traversal or scan                                           | `collectChildNodes` |

| `split`                       | one value → parts                                                         | `splitLines`        |
| `merge`                       | parts → one value                                                         | `mergeWindows`      |
| `sort`                        | reorder                                                                   | `sortEdits`         |

| `expand`                      | compact form → full form                                                  | `expandInputs`      |
| `compress`                    | value → its reversible compact encoding                                   | `compressGraph`     |
| `decompress`                  | reverse a `compress` encoding (non-encoded shorthand is `expand`)         | `decompressGraph`   |
| `to<Result>`                  | cheap representation change                                               | `toPosixPath`       |
| `transform`                   | a package's own source→source operation                                   | `transform`         |

| `stop`         | take a long-running resource out of service, releasing what `start` acquired                                                            | `stopWorker`       |

**Wrappers and factories** — the result is behaviour, not data:

| Prefix    | Contract                                  | Example           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `with<X>` | HOF that runs a callback inside a context | `withJestContext` |
| `make<X>` | factory whose result is itself a function | `makeExcluder`    |

**Framework conventions** — where the ecosystem's prefix is load-bearing, it wins:

| Prefix                   | Contract                                                                                                                | Example          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `use<X>`                 | React hook — the prefix drives rules-of-hooks linting; helpers inside a hook follow the normal taxonomy                 | `useDebounce`    |
| `on<Event>`              | event-callback prop or parameter                                                                                        | `onRowClick`     |
| `handle<Event>`          | local implementation passed to an `on<Event>` prop — the idiomatic React pair; the `handle` ban applies everywhere else | `handleRowClick` |
| `handle<LifecycleEvent>` | implementation of an engine lifecycle callback, keyed by the engine's lifecycle-event enum                              | `handleTick`     |

**Banned** — each is a vaguer or synonymous form of a listed verb; use that one instead: `handle`
(except the `handle<Event>` framework conventions), `process`, `manage`, `do`, `perform` (say what
it does), `execute` (→ `run`), `compute` (→ `build`), `fetch` (→ `read`), `save`/`store` (→
`write`), `delete` (→ `remove`), `search`/`lookup` (→ `find`/`get`).

Algorithm-native vocabulary (`walk`, `backtrack`, `slideDiagonal`) is allowed inside the module
implementing that algorithm — forcing list verbs onto textbook terms hides the algorithm.

## Dependencies

- Pin exact versions — no `^`/`~` ranges. (`bun add` saves exact automatically via `exact = true` in
  bunfig.toml — the rule applies to hand-written edits.)

# backfence

backfence lets Claude Code sessions on different accounts message each other over a tailnet. A relay
(`backfence relay`) identifies every connection through Tailscale and routes by name; a channel
(`backfence channel`) is the MCP server Claude Code spawns per session, which gives Claude the
messaging tools and injects inbound messages as channel events. See `docs/architecture/overview.md`
for how the pieces fit; the README documents install and use, and `docs/guides/configuration.md`
documents config.

## Layout

Single package, no workspaces. `src/` groups its modules by concern, each one primary export per
file: `relay/` owns the server, the per-connection dispatch, the roster, and routing; `channel/` is
the MCP server and its client connection to the relay; `identity/` resolves who a connection belongs
to; `store/` is the SQLite peer and queue store and its migrations; `protocol/` is the wire format;
`shared/` holds config and small helpers used across `src/`. `cli.ts` is the CLI entrypoint. `test/`
holds the relay end-to-end suite and the helpers it shares; `bin/backfence` is the executable shim.
`scripts/` holds repo tooling, not app code.

## Runtime rules

- Bun only. `bun test`, never vitest or jest. `bun <file>`, never node or ts-node.
- The relay never trusts a client's claim about who it is. Identity comes from tailscaled's `whois`
  for the connection's address, or from request headers only in `dev` mode.
- Everything the hooks and CI run is a root `package.json` script; invoke gates by script name,
  never by re-spelling the underlying command.

## Integration contract

- The channel is a Claude Code channel: an MCP server over stdio that declares the `claude/channel`
  capability and emits `notifications/claude/channel`. Claude Code owns the process lifetime.
- The channel reads its session from the environment Claude Code gives every MCP server
  (`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`) and its session name from Claude Code's own
  session registry. It never reads a transcript.
- Meta keys on a channel event are identifiers: letters, digits, and underscores only. Claude Code
  drops any other key without an error.
- State lives in `~/.local/state/backfence/backfence.db` (SQLite: peers, queued messages) and config
  in `~/.config/backfence/config.json`.

## Function naming — project verbs

Project additions to the shared taxonomy (keep in sync with `zgeoff/function-verb` in
`.oxlintrc.json`): `ack`, `answer`, `approve`, `block`, `deliver`, `dispose`, `open`, `refuse`,
`route`, `log`, `mint`.

`answer` builds the response to one protocol request; `route` picks where a message goes and puts it
there; `deliver` hands an inbound message to Claude Code; `refuse` turns a connection away with a
code and reason; `mint` generates an id backfence is the sole authority for.

`init`, `acquireConnection`, `beginTransaction`, `commitTransaction`, `rollbackTransaction`,
`releaseConnection`, and `destroy` are exempt: kysely's `Driver` interface fixes these method names.

## Comments

- No JSDoc. A comment is a run of at most three `//` lines holding only what neither the code, a
  type, a test name, nor the subsystem doc can hold: the reason a line does the non-obvious thing.
- No history or project state in comments — a comment describes the code as it is, never how it got
  that way or what is planned.
- Comments never name other declarations: renames strand the reference. Describe the behavior
  instead.

## Writing

- All committed prose follows the `docs-writing` skill; run its `check-prose.sh` over touched docs
  before committing.

## Testing

Testing conventions live in the `testing` skill (`.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md`). Two rules worth
restating here: never spawn the real `claude` binary in tests (verification against real Claude Code
happens manually before merging changes to the integration contract), and every gate is invoked as a
root package script.

## Dependencies

- Exact pins only (bunfig `exact = true`); the 7-day `minimumReleaseAge` gate applies. When the
  latest version is younger than the gate, pin the newest version that passes — don't add exclusions
  for convenience.
- A dependency knip can't see gets its `knip.json` ignore entry in the same PR that introduces it,
  with the reason in the PR description.
