# Releasing

Releases are fully automated off `main` via
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) (manifest mode) plus an OIDC npm
publish step in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. No npm tokens live in CI. The setup mirrors
[zgeoff/tools](https://github.com/zgeoff/tools/blob/main/RELEASING.md).

## Flow

1. A `feat:`/`fix:` PR merges to `main`.
2. `main.yml` runs release-please, which opens (or updates) the release PR: version bump per
   conventional-commit type, `CHANGELOG.md`, manifest update. The job syncs `bun.lock` on the PR
   branch (the version is recorded there too) and auto-merges the PR.
3. The merge triggers `main.yml` again: release-please tags `backfence@X.Y.Z`, creates the GitHub
   release, and the publish step runs `bun pm pack` then `npm publish <tarball> --provenance` under
   OIDC.

## One-time setup

### GitHub App (required for the automated chain)

`GITHUB_TOKEN` events don't trigger workflows, so a release PR it creates gets no CI and its merge
would never fire the publish run. The workflow therefore uses a GitHub App token; without it,
release PRs are still created but must be merged by hand.

1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App (or reuse
   `zgeoff-release`), any homepage URL, uncheck "Active" under Webhook.
2. Repository permissions: Contents → Read and write, Pull requests → Read and write. Save, then
   install the App on `zgeoff/backfence`.
3. Generate a private key (downloads a `.pem`). In the repo settings, add:
   - Actions variable `RELEASE_APP_ID` = the App's client ID
   - Actions secret `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` = the `.pem` contents
4. Repo Settings → Actions → General → check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull
   requests".

### First publish

npm trusted publishing can't create a package that doesn't exist yet, so the first publish is
manual, then OIDC takes over:

```sh
npm login
scripts/first-publish.sh
```

The script publishes the current version from your machine and prints the trusted publisher settings
to add on npmjs.com (Access → Trusted Publisher: repo `zgeoff/backfence`, workflow `main.yml`). Once
that's saved, CI publishes all future versions with no tokens.

## Troubleshooting

- Release PR open but nothing published: the App isn't configured (or its token step failed) — the
  PR won't auto-merge, and merging it by hand from the GitHub UI works fine and triggers the publish
  run.
- `npm publish` 404/403 on the first CI release: the trusted publisher isn't configured, or the
  first manual publish never happened.
- Tagged and GitHub-released but the npm publish failed: re-run just the publish via

  ```sh
  gh workflow run main.yml -f republish_paths='["."]'
  ```

  Versions already on the registry are skipped. Re-running the failed job instead won't help when
  the failure is deterministic — a re-run uses the workflow file as of the original commit.

- Cutting a specific version: put `Release-As: X.Y.Z` in the footer of a commit that lands on
  `main`. With squash merges that means the squash commit body, so pass it explicitly:
  `gh pr merge <n> --squash --body 'Release-As: X.Y.Z'`. release-please reads the footer from
  commits since the last release and bumps to that version instead of the one the commit types
  imply.
